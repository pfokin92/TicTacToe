# TicTacToe

## Description

This is an education project. `TicTacToe` is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns placing either an "X" or an "O" in an empty square on the grid. The goal of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game starts with an empty grid, and the first player places their symbol in any of the nine squares. The second player then takes their turn, placing their symbol in any remaining empty square. Play continues in this way, with each player taking turns until one player manages to get three of their symbols in a row, or all nine squares are filled without either player winning.

If a player manages to get three of their symbols in a row, they win the game. If all nine squares are filled without either player winning, the game is a tie.

`TicTacToe` is a classic game that is often used to teach children about strategy and critical thinking. It is also a popular game to play on paper or on a chalkboard, and there are many variations and adaptations of the game that have been created over the years.
